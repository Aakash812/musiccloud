## Retrospective activity
In the first two iterations we did a poor job at time management and planning ahead. Both times we got caught up in one aspect of the iteration and didnâ€™t focus on all requirements as much as we should have. In the first iteration this led to being very pressed for time. In the second iteration we tried to manage this better, but still struggled to work on all aspects equally or as much as they needed. As a group we were more drawn to the coding aspects, and pushed off documenting and planning as less important. This was reflected in the quality of our documentation and grade for the first iteration. 

In iteration three we will spend more time defining the scope and objectives of this milestone. We will have a more defined planning phase where we will write out and define everything that needs to be achieved and worked on in this iteration. During this time we will develop a timeline for the iteration. Setting specific deadlines for different portions of the iteration, breaking down what needs to be done into smaller chunks. This will help us stay on track and complete this iteration by the deadline. Throughout the iteration we will review and revise the project plan. This will ensure that we are on track and if any issues or delays come up we are able to identify them early on. This will help us be able to predict issues in advance, so we can address them and prevent any further delays. 

At the end of the iteration we can measure our success by whether or not we achieved everything we planned to achieve. This will be based on the iteration requirements and project plan we came up with along with the time it took to complete everything. Did it line up with our plan? Once the iteration is evaluated we can also compare our mark to previous iterations. Did it improve? And in what areas? We would hope to get better feedback on our documentation and completion of the assignment. If we receive a higher grade than our previous average it will be a clear reflection on our efforts to improve our planning. By implementing the above methods early on in this iteration, we can expect that we are better prepared for the upcoming weeks as we work on this project. This is in hopes that we can be more successful in this iteration than past ones, and help set our project up for success.
