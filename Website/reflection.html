          <div class="text">Producing MusicLoud presented our team with significant challenges, primarily related to time management and task completion. As none of us had prior experience using Android Studios, it took us some time to gain familiarity with its functionalities. Consequently, we faced setbacks in completing the user stories we had planned for each iteration, which accumulated and left us with a considerable workload for the final iteration. Consequently, we had to omit several features we had intended to include, which impacted the completeness of the final product.</div>
          <div class="text">Although we managed to code some features more efficiently than we anticipated, we failed to account for the demands of our other courses during the term. Additionally, the learning curve for each aspect of the application was steeper than we had anticipated, which further contributed to our time management challenges. Since each team member was responsible for understanding and incorporating their colleagues' code when adding new features, the process was even more complex. Among all the features we developed, the playlist feature took the longest to create, as it required careful consideration regarding how to store songs and maintain consistency across the database.</div>
          <div class="text">As a team, we learned that communication and regular meetings were essential to keep us on track and accountable. We recognized that each person must complete their assigned tasks, and we needed to establish due dates to create a more effective project management system. Moving forward, we aim to continue learning and understanding each aspect of the application to streamline the development process. We will establish accountability by scheduling regular meetings, setting deadlines for tasks, and creating to-do lists to help us stay on track. Additionally, we will prioritize testing throughout the development process, recognizing its importance in creating a successful application. From our experience with MusicLoud, we realized that we need to be proactive and set achievable goals to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the project's demands. We learned to adapt to changes and work collaboratively to overcome challenges.
